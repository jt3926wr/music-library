Authors: Anthony, Edwin

## Description
This project will allow a user to browse a pre-defined selection of music albums.  The user will also be able to add a new music album to the existing list.

### Browsing
The user will be able to browse and sort through a pre-populated list of albums using a variety of properties.  These include:
- Album Artist
- Album Name
- Year
- Track Number
- Song Title
- Song Artist
- Genre

Browsing will take place on one page, and the user will be able to change how information is displayed/sorted.

## Entry
The user will be able to enter a new album to be displayed alongside a pre-populated list of albums.  The user will need to enter all the properties listed above.

Entry will take place on a separate page.  The user may be able to select from an existing **Album Artist** and a selection of **genres**.  Once an album's base information is entered (**Album Artist**, **Album Name**, and **Year**), the user will be able to add tracks to the new album.  Tracks will have the **track number** provided, and each must include a **song title** and **artist**.
